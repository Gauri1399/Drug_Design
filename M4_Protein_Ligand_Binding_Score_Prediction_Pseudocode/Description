## Description

This project implements a comprehensive pipeline to predict protein-ligand binding affinities using the DeepAffinity AI model. The workflow includes:

* Protein Selection: Identifying target proteins based on specific criteria such as resolution and presence of ligand-binding sites from the Protein Data Bank (PDB).
* Ligand Selection: Retrieving candidate ligands from PubChem that satisfy drug-likeness criteria (e.g., Lipinski’s Rule of 5) for reliable binding predictions.
* Data Preparation: Collecting protein sequences and ligand chemical structures, encoding them with pretrained DeepAffinity encoders, and assembling training datasets from experimental binding affinity databases.
* Model Training: Training the DeepAffinity model on encoded protein-ligand pairs to learn accurate binding affinity prediction.
* Prediction & Analysis: Applying the trained model to predict binding scores of selected ligand candidates against the target protein, followed by visualization of predicted affinities.

This pipeline facilitates in silico drug discovery by integrating structural bioinformatics, cheminformatics, and deep learning approaches to accelerate identification of promising drug candidates.

##Usage

1. Set Target Protein Criteria
Define the characteristics of the protein you want to analyze (e.g., “kinase involved in cancer”).

2. Run Protein Selection
Execute the get_protein function to retrieve protein structures matching the criteria from PDB.

3. Set Ligand Keywords
Specify keywords to search for relevant ligands in PubChem (e.g., “kinase inhibitor”).

4. Run Ligand Selection
Use get_ligands to fetch ligands that satisfy drug-likeness rules for downstream analysis.

5. Prepare Training Data
Collect protein sequences and ligand structures for training the DeepAffinity model, along with binding affinity data from databases like BindingDB.

6. Train the DeepAffinity Model
Train the AI model on encoded protein and ligand features to learn binding affinity relationships.

7. Predict Binding Affinities
Apply the trained model to predict binding scores for the selected ligands against the target protein.

8. Visualize Results
Use the PLOT_BINDING_AFFINITIES function to create bar charts of predicted binding affinity scores.
