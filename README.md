# Drug Design & Development – Computational and AI-Driven Drug Discovery

This repository contains coursework and projects from my Drug Design and Development course, focusing on the integration of machine learning, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics in modern drug discovery workflows.

## Machine Learning and AI Components
- QSAR modeling using regression and classification algorithms  
- Random Forest and Linear Regression models for activity prediction  
- Model evaluation using R², RMSE, MAE, cross-validation, and Y-randomization  
- Ligand-based virtual screening using molecular descriptors  
- Deep learning–based protein–ligand affinity prediction (DeepAffinity-style workflow)  

## Structure-Based Drug Design
- Protein pocket detection and cavity analysis  
- Classification of active and allosteric binding sites  
- Molecular docking score analysis  
- Binding affinity prediction and visualization  

## Cheminformatics and Screening
- SMILES-based descriptor calculation (Molecular Weight, LogP, TPSA, H-bond donors/acceptors)  
- Morgan fingerprint generation and Tanimoto similarity analysis  
- Drug-likeness filtering using Lipinski’s Rule of Five  
- ADMET property prediction and filtering  

This repository demonstrates the application of computational and AI-based methods across multiple stages of the drug discovery pipeline, from target analysis and ligand selection to predictive modeling and binding affinity estimation.
