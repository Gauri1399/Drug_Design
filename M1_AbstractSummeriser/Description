## Summary
Paper Abstract Summarizer is a lightweight Python tool that uses natural language processing models to automatically generate concise summaries of scientific paper abstracts. This project leverages Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library with pre-trained models to help quickly grasp the key points of lengthy abstracts.

## Features
Summarizes long abstracts into shorter, easy-to-read versions
Uses advanced transformer models (e.g., DistilBART) for high-quality summaries
Simple Python API that can be integrated into research workflows or web apps
Ideal for literature review, academic writing, or knowledge extraction

## How it works
1. The tool loads a pre-trained summarization model and applies it to the abstract text. It produces a condensed summary that retains the most important information, helping users save time when scanning through multiple papers.
2. Replace the text variable with the paragraph you'd like to summarize.
3. Adjust the word_count value to set the desired length of your summary.
