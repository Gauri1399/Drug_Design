# SmileML – SMILES-Based Molecule Activity Prediction with ML

## Project Overview
SmileML is a Python workflow that predicts the biological activity of chemical compounds directly from **SMILES strings**. It uses **molecular descriptors**, **fingerprint similarity**, and **machine learning models** to classify compounds as active or inactive. This workflow allows researchers and chemists to quickly screen small molecules for potential activity.

## Features
- Input molecules as **SMILES strings**
- Compute molecular descriptors:
  - Molecular Weight (MolWt)
  - LogP
  - Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA)
  - Number of H-bond donors/acceptors
- Generate **Morgan fingerprints** and calculate **Tanimoto similarity**
- Simulate docking scores and classify compounds as **active/inactive**
- Train a **Random Forest classifier** for activity prediction
- Create regression metrics and **Y-randomization** validation for model reliability
- Easily extendable to include more descriptors, fingerprints, or ML models

## How It Works
1. **SMILES Input:** Enter a list of SMILES strings separated by commas.
2. **Descriptor Calculation:** Compute key molecular features using RDKit.
3. **Fingerprint Similarity:** Calculate structural similarity using Morgan fingerprints.
4. **Docking Simulation:** Simulate docking scores (or use real activity data) to define active/inactive labels.
5. **Machine Learning:** Train a Random Forest classifier on descriptors to predict activity.
6. **Validation:** Evaluate model performance with metrics like R², RMSE, MAE, and optionally perform Y-randomization to ensure predictions are not due to chance.

## The  workflow produces the following outputs:

- Molecular descriptors for each input SMILES (MolWt, LogP, TPSA, H-bond donors/acceptors)  
- Tanimoto similarity matrix between molecules  
- Simulated docking scores and activity labels (active/inactive)  
- Random Forest classification report  
- Optional regression metrics and Y-randomization validation
