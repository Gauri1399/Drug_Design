AI-Driven Drug Failure Analysis & Structural Intelligence Pipeline

##Overview
This project is a Python-based bioinformatics pipeline that integrates biomedical databases, NLP, and structural biology tools to analyze failed drug candidates and investigate their molecular targets.

Drug development has a >90% failure rate in clinical trials. This system programmatically investigates drug attrition by:
  * Querying PubChem for compound metadata
  * Mining PubMed for failed clinical trial publications
  * Applying NLP (spaCy) to extract failure-related signals
  * Performing keyword frequency analysis and visualization
  *Fetching AlphaFold protein structures via UniProt ID
  * Rendering interactive 3D structural visualizations using py3Dmol
The project demonstrates how AI-assisted literature mining and structural bioinformatics can be combined to analyze translational drug failures.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then install the required packages:

```bash
pip install biopython py3Dmol spacy matplotlib requests
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
---

## Usage
1. Update the `main()` function in the script with your:
   * **Drug name** (the drug you want to analyze)
   * **Target protein UniProt ID** (protein interacting with the drug)

2. Run the script:
```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

3. The script will:
   * Search PubChem for the drug compound ID.
   * Retrieve PubMed articles related to failed clinical trials of the drug.
   * Extract and display common failure reasons from abstracts.
   * Download and visualize the AlphaFold structure of the target protein.
