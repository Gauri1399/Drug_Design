# Ligand-Based Virtual Screening & Activity Prediction

This Python project performs ligand-based virtual screening using **SMILES molecular representations**, **RDKit molecular descriptors**, and **machine learning** to predict compound activity. The workflow allows users to input SMILES strings, compute key descriptors (molecular weight, hydrogen bond donors/acceptors), simulate docking scores, classify compounds as active or inactive with a Random Forest classifier, and analyze results. 

**Features:**
- SMILES parsing and molecule validation  
- Molecular descriptor calculation  
- Docking score simulation and activity labeling  
- Machine learning classification and evaluation  
- Interactive analysis and visualization  

**How to Use:**
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gauri1399/M6_LigandActivity_VirtualScreening.git
cd M6_LigandActivity_VirtualScreening
