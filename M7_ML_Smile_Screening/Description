# SMILES-Based Molecule Activity Prediction with ML

## Project Overview
SmileML is a Python workflow that predicts the biological activity of chemical compounds directly from their **SMILES strings**. Using **molecular descriptors** and **machine learning models**, the project allows chemists and researchers to quickly screen small molecules for potential activity.

**How it works:**
1. **SMILES Input:** Users provide a list of SMILES strings representing molecules.
2. **Descriptor Calculation:** Computes molecular features such as **Molecular Weight, LogP, TPSA**, and optionally others using **RDKit**.
3. **Fingerprint Analysis:** Generates **Morgan fingerprints** and calculates **Tanimoto similarity** between molecules.
4. **Machine Learning Prediction:** Trains a model (e.g., Random Forest) to classify compounds as **active or inactive** based on descriptors.
5. **Model Validation:** Evaluates performance using metrics like **R², RMSE, MAE**, and performs **Y-randomization** to check for chance correlations.

**Key Features:**
- SMILES parsing and molecule validation
- Molecular descriptor calculation and fingerprint generation
- Similarity analysis using Tanimoto scores
- Machine learning classification and performance evaluation
- Flexible and extendable for additional descriptors or ML models

**Getting Started:**
